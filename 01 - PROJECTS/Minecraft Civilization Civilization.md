# Arc 1: Escaping Civilization Civilization
## Act 1: Becoming Civilization Pro

## Part 1: Escape the Nether

### Scene 1: Introduction
You, You're finally awake. You were trying to join the server, right?
The new players immidiately get sent to the nether upon joining the server.
MC gets taken to the nether and is given a private house, fairly uncommon but not unheard of, as there are lots of houses built by the pros.

the noobs live in the nether, and mine for netherite, cut trees, and tend to the hoglin farms
civilization pros get to build houses, roads, and other buildings
It's the dream of a civilization noob to become a civilization pro
No one knows how to rank up to become a civilization pro. The pros just take noobs seemingly at random.

main character works at the farms
sees someone resist the civilization pros
they take him away to the overworld, never to be seen again

Someone dies due to an angered hoglin in the farms
there are hundreds of thousands of us civilization noobs, so the pros don't care if some of us die. 
no respawns

Only the civilization pros get beds to be able to respawn. 
Civilization pros live in the overworld
All we can do is do what we're told, but that's life in civilization civilization. 

### Scene 2: Social time
Meet other civilization noobs

On the way there, MC notices **a tense exchange** between two noobs in a corner. One of them passes an item - perhaps glowstone dust or a note containing directions to a hidden location. When MC subtly tries to ask about it, the noobs shut him out, claiming it’s nothing important. However, this further raises his curiosity about **a possible underground network** of noobs with hidden information.

Later, one of the noobs recounts the story of **someone who tried to escape** to the overworld but was **captured and executed**.
This reinforces the danger of defying the pros while also hinting at **possible escape routes** that may still be viable.

Character: The Loyal Worker
A noob who **defends the pros**, believing that obedience is the only way to survive.
They argue that resisting the system is pointless and that pros and noobs must maintain their roles.

MC goes back to his house and gets ready for rest. on the way there MC stares at the **glowstone formations** at the horizon of the Nether’s ceiling, feeling both trapped and inspired. He imagines what the overworld might look like and what it would feel like to walk under the open sky.
### Scene 3: Meeting the Piglin
The next day, getting ready for work in the tree farms, MC cleans up a bit after everyone has left for their breaks, and is the only one left. 
He hears scurrying and sees something he investigates and finds the piglin

piglin was just making its way to the hoglin farm to steal food for it's settlement
MC thought they were extinct
Piglin panics, offers crying obsidian in exchange for keeping his existence secret
MC agrees, not looking for harm, and tells him to leave and don't get caught

He leaves through a hard to see hole in the fences and the MC takes note.

He heads back to his house and interacts with the loyal worker from the previous scene again. The worker notices that MC seems distracted. "You’re thinking too much about those stories. Forget them. The pros will notice if you start acting suspicious, and you'll never get chosen to be promoted.

A group of pros leave for a longer operation in the nether in which they would need to be able to respawn, but there isn't very good infrastructure in the nether, leaving the way they do that up to the viewer (it's respawn anchors)

MC subtly asks, "What do you think those pros need for such a long operation? Do you think they’ll be able to come back if something happens to them?" The worker shrugs, dismissing the question. "Maybe they have a trick. Doesn't matter to us—beds don't work here, and neither do we unless we do our job."
### Scene 4: Reading the forbidden archives
While cleaning up a pros-only storage area near the farms, MC stumbles across a room that he has never seen before. With all the pros in the overworld for the break, he enters and finds a room of archives

After stumbling, he opens a secret compartment in the archive room, finding a book on a lectern that mentions **respawn anchors** and glowstone. an ancient technology of the piglins. The document refers to it as a "classified resource," forbidden to noobs under penalty of death.

The pros use the respawn anchors when doing operations in the nether, but since they're so expensive as crying obsidian is near gone from the world after the supposed piglin extinction, they rarely do extensive operations in the nether. 

MC hears **footsteps** approaching the archive room and hides. A **fellow noob**, part of the rumored underground network, enters to retrieve something.
### Scene 5: The quest for glowstone

MC goes to meetup with the piglin on the break day when he knows he will come to get food for his tribe thing

He talks to the piglin and attempts to convince him to tell him how to get glowstone. 

The piglins do not give glowstone for free, in their culture they must trade gold, or get it themselves. The piglin ally offers to guide MC to a **piglin hunting party** that knows of a safe route to high glowstone deposits. The piglins agree to help in exchange for **food, netherite scraps, or weapons**. Together, they launch a **coordinated expedition** to secure the glowstone.

The piglins are **suspicious of MC** and might betray him if they sense weakness.
The **expedition is attacked** by waves of hostile mobs (blazes, wither skeletons) that threaten to wipe out the entire group.

MC has to **save a piglin’s life** to earn their respect.
MC gains not only the glowstone but **valuable allies** who offer further assistance in his attempt to rank up to a pro.

### Scene 6: Activating the Respawn Anchor & going to the overworld

Piglin can't go to the overworld becuase he'll become zombified like all the rest of the pigmen after the war. MC has to go alone.
They devise a plan after the civ pros go on break, MC will sneak in to the civilization pro base and escape. 

The night comes and they enact the plan

MC sneaks past the few break day guards, and types the passcode he learned to open the door to the portal room

He enters the portal.

He enters an empty room with windows and a door that he presumes is guarded by guards.
He finds a switch to the lights, and turns them off, then breaks one of the windows.
This gets the guards attention, and they come in opening the 1 way iron doors
MC sneaks out into the alleyway.

The base is a fortified outpost with barracks, farms, and a resource depot. The guards are distracted, trying to find the materials to fix the window.
MC uses the opportunity to explore and locate pro-only archives or useful items before heading toward the settlement’s plaza to gather bearings. He finds the exit to the outside of the pro settlement with a large gate.

MC Overhears a Secret Meeting discussing war plans for a battle between the biomes
they mention resource shortages, and discontent among the masters tightening control over their operations and daily tasks. 

MC learns that they are low on men, and might need to size down the housing plaza. Especially after the recent ambush with the desert biome at a river fork, of the 50 men, they lost 5 deviants permanently and 37 respawned, and 8 missing, 4 of which respawned later after dying of natural causes. Someone comes near and MC needs to move.

Later, MC finds a map of the region, and sees a river with a fork, and pieces together that he might be able to find a fallen deviant pro's helmet in the aftermath if he can make it there.

He decides he's seen enough, and tries to make his way back to the portal, but he is unsuccessful, leading to a chase scene, and he is found by a civilization master, who doesn't hesitate to send him back to the nether.
