# Mid-research thoughts

Originally I was going to be talking mainly about local politics and how gem county specifically has been shooting itself in the foot in terms of future outlook, but now I'm realizing that this is not an isolated issue.

Don't forget to try to tell emotionally engaging stories






## Random talking points
#### Nimbys
Idaho has a problem with californians moving in, red californians don't like californian politics so when they get older, and their kids move out and want to downscale, they look for a rural small town community vibe to move to. 

All of these people are the biggest nimbys ever.
talk about this
