# Abyssal Ascent Episode 2
 second layer Episode 2: Form the PISS agency & identify and interrogate enemies
 GROUP UP AND FIND JEREMY
 CAPTURE HIM AND BRING HIM TO INTERROGATION ROOM
 QUESTION HIM ABOUT THE FOLLOWING THINGS:
 mr nice cop comes in 
 Hi, i'm here to ask you some questions
 jeremy tries to be helpful but it's no use
 Listen, you're going to have to help me out here or else I need to get someone else
 I'll answer your questions what do you want from me
 Well, since you won't talk, you leave me no choice, it's time to bring out the bad cop.
 
 WHO DO YOU WORK FOR
 threaten to eat his pet beans
 NICK nick has a plan to begin operations on the third layer
 WHERE IS HE 
 HE usually hangs out on the second layer gathering materials
 IS THERE ANYONE ELSE YOU KNOW ABOUT
so far its just me and thiccolas

To find all second-order derivatives of the function ( g(u, v) = u^3v^4 - 2u\sqrt{v^3} + u^6 - \sin(3v) ), we begin by finding the first partial derivatives with respect to ( u ) and ( v ).

First, the partial derivative of ( g ) with respect to ( u ): $$ g_u = \frac{\partial g}{\partial u} = 3u^2v^4 - 2\sqrt{v^3} + 6u^5 $$

Next, the partial derivative of ( g ) with respect to ( v ):$$ [ g_v = \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} = 4u^3v^3 - \frac{3u}{\sqrt{v}} - 3\cos(3v) ]$$

Now, we find the second-order derivatives by taking the partial derivatives of ( g_u ) and ( g_v ) with respect to ( u ) and ( v ).

1. Second-order derivative with respect to ( u ) twice: $$[ g_{uu} = \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial u^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}(3u^2v^4 - 2\sqrt{v^3} + 6u^5) = 6uv^4 + 30u^4 ]$$
    
2. Second-order mixed derivative with respect to ( u ) and ( v ): $$[ g_{uv} = \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial u \partial v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v}(3u^2v^4 - 2\sqrt{v^3} + 6u^5) = 12u^2v^3 - \frac{3u}{v^{3/2}} ]$$
    
3. Second-order mixed derivative with respect to ( v ) and ( u ) (which equals ( g_{uv} ) by the symmetry of second derivatives): $$[ g_{vu} = \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial v \partial u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u}(4u^3v^3 - \frac{3u}{\sqrt{v}} - 3\cos(3v)) = 12u^2v^3 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{v}} ]$$
    
4. Second-order derivative with respect to ( v ) twice:$$ [ g_{vv} = \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial v^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v}(4u^3v^3 - \frac{3u}{\sqrt{v}} - 3\cos(3v)) = 12u^3v^2 + \frac{3u}{2v^{3/2}} + 9\sin(3v) ]$$
    

Therefore, the second-order derivatives of ( g(u, v) ) are: $$[ g_{uu} = 6uv^4 + 30u^4 ]$$$$ [ g_{uv} = g_{vu} = 12u^2v^3 - \frac{3u}{v^{3/2}} ]$$ $$ [ g_{vv} = 12u^3v^2 + \frac{3u}{2v^{3/2}} + 9\sin(3v) ]$$
